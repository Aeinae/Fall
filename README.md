# Fall
Fall is an action-adventure platformer (game) coded entirely in Python (in perhaps the most unprofessional way) using no GUI; instead exploiting string printing. This, however has its own limits:
    screen flashing, more often than never, on update (NOTE: This game may trigger photosensitive epilepsy);
    input lags are commonplace;
    some interactions may not be evident, explicit, or coherent;
    and some inputs may not be registered properly.
Regardless, the game is functional, and playable.

    ~ A game by Aeinae (Nexys), conceptualized by InversedQ.
